The ruins of the Martial Alliance headquarters. The once-great leaders lie defeated.
~ setScene(5)
Jin stands alone, bruised and bloodied, as the sky turns dark.
~ setScene(6)
The forces of the Demonic Sect march across the land, their monstrous forces unstoppable.

The martial world had faced many threats, but none so great as the Demonic Sect. With too few leaders united, the Martial Alliance crumbled under the weight of their monstrous might.
Jin's efforts were valiant, but it was not enough.

Namgung Jin had fought with everything he had, but his failure to unite the sects sealed the fate of the Central Plains. The Alliance could not withstand the overwhelming power of the sect’s twisted forces.
One by one, the great clans and temples fell, unable to hold back the tide of darkness.

The Central Plains were lost, and the world plunged into an era of darkness once more. Namgung Jin, the last hope of the alliance, could only watch as the Heavenly Demonic Sect claimed victory.
In the end, not all battles are won with the sword—some are lost in the hearts of those who failed to come together.
And so, the light of the Central Plains faded, leaving only shadows in its wake.

The END.

YOU HAVE OBTAINED THE BAD ENDING
