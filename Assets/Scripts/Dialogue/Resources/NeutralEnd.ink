~ setScene(3)
The battlefield is quiet, but victory feels hollow. Jin alone in front of the leaders as they survey the heavy losses around them. Fires smolder in the distance, and the ground is littered with fallen warriors.
~ setScene(6)
The Demonic Sect was pushed back, but victory came at a heavy price. The forces of the Martial Alliance fought bravely, but their strength alone was not enough to prevent the suffering and loss that followed. The martial world paid dearly for the lack of unity.

Namgung Jin had done all he could, yet as he looked upon the fallen, he could not help but wonder: could more have been done? The absence of key allies had tipped the balance of this war, leaving deep scars on the martial world.

The Demonic Sect had been driven into the shadows, but the cost of their defeat weighed heavily on Jinâ€™s heart. Though the Central Plains survived, its future remained uncertain. The battle was won, but the wounds of war would take time to heal.

The END.


YOU HAVE OBTAINED THE NEUTRAL ENDING
