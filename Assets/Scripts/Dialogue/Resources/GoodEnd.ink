~ setScene(2)
The sun rises over a battlefield littered with remnants of the Demonic Sect. Jin stands alongside the leaders of the Martial Alliance, victorious, as the wind carries away the last remnants of darkness.

Through courage, wisdom, and unity, the martial world stood strong against the rising tide of chaos. The Demonic Sect, once thought unstoppable, was defeated again, their monstrous forces scattered and their dark ambitions shattered."

~ setScene(3)
At the heart of this victory stood Namgung Jin, the youngest son of the Namgung Clan. He was no longer the boy who began this journey, but a true protector of the Central Plains, forged in the fires of battle and bound by the trust of those he united.

The martial world would remember him not for his strength alone, but for his ability to bring even the most powerful sects together for a common cause. Peace returned to the Central Plains, and Jin's name would forever be etched in its historyâ€”as a hero, a leader, and a beacon of hope.

The END.
