Greetings, traveler.
*[I greet the Head Monk of the Shaolin]
Tell me, what brings you to the sacred grounds of Shaolin?
    **[I'm here to deliver a message]
        A message? And from whom, might I ask? Who are you, traveler?
            ** *[It's from the Alliance leader]
                The Martial Alliance... I see. Please, share the message with me.
                    ****[The Demonic sect is back]

~ setQuestStatus("questShaolin", "incomplete")
[The Head Monkâ€™s expression becomes grave, his voice solemn.]
    The Demonic Sect... troubling news indeed.
    In fact, we have recently received word from the villagers at the base of the temple.
    A giant bamboo monster has appeared in the bamboo forest to the east, wreaking havoc!
    [The Head monk pauses, his expression darkening.]
    After hearing about the demonic sect making a return...I fear this creature may be connected to their dark magic.
    If you can defeat this monster and bring peace to the villagers, I will be free of worry and join the Alliance without hesitation.
    * [I shall do my best]
    [The monk bows slightly, his eyes filled with resolve.]
    Amitabha. May your path be clear, and may you succeed.
    I will inform the guards to allow you passage. May the Buddha guide you on your journey
    -> END

    [The head monk nods but seems slightly impatient.]
    Don't take too long now. The villagers are suffering.
    -> END

{option == 1:
[The Head Monk frowns, his disappointment evident.]
    I'm disappointed
    I didn't know the Alliance was this weak.
    Looks like I'll have to stay here and protect the Shaolin instead.
